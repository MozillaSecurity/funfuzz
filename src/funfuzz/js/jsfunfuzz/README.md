*jsfunfuzz* creates random JavaScript function bodies (including invalid ones) to test many parts of JavaScript engines.

The largest module of jsfunfuzz is [gen-grammar.js](gen-grammar.js).  thinking loosely in terms of "statements", "expressions", "lvalues", "literals", etc. It's almost a context-free grammar fuzzer... |cat| and |totallyRandom| especially make it seem like one.

Once it creates a function body, it does the following things with it:
* Splits it in half and tries to compile each half, mostly to find bugs in the compiler's error-handling.
* Compiles it
* Executes it
* If executing returned a generator, loops through the generator.


## Running jsfunfuzz

To test an existing SpiderMonkey shell called `./js`, run:

`funfuzz/js/loopjsfunfuzz.py --random-flags --compare-jit 20 mozilla-central ./js`

* `--random-flags` tells it to use [shellFlags.py](../shellFlags.py) to
* `--compare-jit` tells it to run [compare_jit.py](../compare_jit.py) on most of the generated code, detecting bugs where adding optimization flags like --ion-eager changes the output.
* `20` tells it to kill any instance that runs for more than 20 seconds
* `mozilla-central` or any other string is no longer used, and this argument will be removed in the future.

If loopjsfunfuzz detects a new bug, it will run [Lithium](https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/lithium/) to reduce the testcase. It will call Lithium with either [jsInteresting.py](../jsInteresting.py) or [compare_jit.py](../compare_jit.py) as the "interestingness test".

Using [bot.py](../../bot.py) --test-type=js, you can automate downloading or building new versions of the SpiderMonkey shell, and running several instances of loopjsfunfuzz.py for parallelism.

Through randorderfuzz, if the harness detects tests in the mozilla-central tree, it may load or incorporate tests into its fuzzing input in a random order.
