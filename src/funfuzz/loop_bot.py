"""Loop of { update repos, call bot } to allow things to run unattended
All command-line options are passed through to bot

Since this script updates the fuzzing repo, it should be very simple, and use subprocess.call() rather than import

Config-ish bits should move to bot, OR move into a config file,
OR this file should subprocess-call ITSELF rather than using a while loop.
