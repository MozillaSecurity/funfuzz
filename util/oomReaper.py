# ulimit for memory does not work on OS X.
# So, I wrote this thing to kill off bloated processes before they:
#   * Cause slow thrashing
#   * Cause OS X to pause _other_ processes (and show the force quit window)
#   * Cause OS X to kernel panic
# I decided not to use 'psutil' or 'syrupy' and instead just parse |ps| output.
