## FAQ

**Q: Compilation is broken! How do I use autoBisect to see when the builds broke?**

Specify the failing revision hash in the "-e" parameter, along with desired "-b" options to build the desired SpiderMonkey build configuration. This failing revision hash must be from **Mercurial**.

```funfuzz/autobisectjs/autoBisect.py -l bad -e FAILINGREV -b "--enable-debug --enable-more-deterministic"```

When done, find the first working revision hash after the breakage, as below.

**Q: Compilation has finished breaking. How do I know when the builds were working again?**

Similar to the above, but use "-s" instead of "-e".

```funfuzz/autobisectjs/autoBisect.py -l bad -s FAILINGREV -b "--enable-debug --enable-more-deterministic```

**Q: What should I do with the known broken changeset ranges to prevent autoBisect from retesting those revisions?**

(This assumes you have the first bad and first good revision hashes as per the 2 questions above.)

You can add them to the known broken range functions in [knownBrokenEarliestWorking.py](knownBrokenEarliestWorking.py). Add the first bad and first good changeset **Mercurial** hashes of the build breakage and its fix, along with a short comment.

**Q: The testcase is giving out assorted varied exit codes as it gets executed by older binaries. How can I fixate to a particular interesting exit code?**

Pass in the "-w" argument along with the desired exit code to autoBisect. If it is negative, e.g. -11, pass in 128 - (**exit code number**), e.g. 128 - (-11) = 128 + 11 = 139, or "-w 139".

**Q: The testcase is intermittent and giving weird results! What should I do to try and get more reliable results?**

You can try using interestingness tests to look out for the desired symptom, see [the examples](examples-autoBisect.md).

**Q: What happens when a new operating system is released, and we now have a new changeset hash that has to be updated as the earliest known working revision?**

You can add the earliest known working **Mercurial** revision to the earliestKnownWorkingRev function in [knownBrokenEarliestWorking.py](knownBrokenEarliestWorking.py).

**Q: Does autoBisect work on nightly SpiderMonkey js shells yet?**

No, not yet. Currently it only uses ["tinderbox-builds" js shells](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tinderbox-builds/mozilla-inbound-macosx64-debug/) by default, which are stored on a per-checkin basis only for the past month. Patches accepted!

**Q: How does autoBisect compare with [mozregression](http://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/)?**

When autoBisect was proposed and written in 2009, mozregression did not exist yet. Since 2010, both have been developed independently of each other.

autoBisect was [first written](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482536) (in Bash) [with results](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=476655#c8) in March 2009.

mozregression had its [first landing](https://github.com/mozilla/mozregression/commit/d50509b36cb6ba45d7c54917f528bdf482d2c5e6) in February 2010.

autoBisect supports bisections using compiled and downloaded (tinderbox-builds) SpiderMonkey js shells (with rudimentary support for Firefox), while mozregression supports nightly and inbound builds [for various Mozilla products](http://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/).
